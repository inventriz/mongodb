Write Concern - at the DB level
-------------------------------
 db.getWriteConcern()
 db.setWriteConcern({w : 0})
 db.unsetWriteConcern({w : 0})

Modify Default Write Concern
----------------------------
cfg = rs.conf()
cfg.settings = {}
cfg.settings.getLastErrorDefaults = { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
rs.reconfig(cfg)
 
Read Preference
---------------
db.collection.find().readPref( { mode: 'nearest' } )
db.getMongo().setReadPref('primaryPreferred')

primary  - Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set primary.
primaryPreferred - In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it is unavailable, operations
read from secondary members.
secondary - All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.
secondaryPreferred - In most situations, operations read from secondary members but if no secondary
members are available, operations read from the primary.
nearest - Operations read from member of the replica set with the least network latency,
irrespective of the member’s type.



Heartbeat
---------
Replica set members send heartbeats (pings) to each other every two seconds. If a heartbeat does not
return within 10 seconds, the other members mark the delinquent member as inaccessible.


Change the oplog size
---------------------
Restart a Secondary in Standalone Mode on a Different Port Shut down the mongod instance for one of the
non-primary members of your replica set. For example, to shut down, use the db.shutdownServer() method:
db.shutdownServer()
Restart this mongod as a standalone instance running on a different port and without the --replSet parameter. Use
a command similar to the following:
mongod --port 37017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb
Create a Backup of the Oplog (Optional) Optionally, backup the existing oplog on the standalone instance, as in
the following example:
mongodump --db local --collection 'oplog.rs' --port 37017

Recreate the Oplog with a New Size and a Seed Entry
use local
db.temp.drop()
db.temp.save( db.oplog.rs.find( { }, { ts: 1, h: 1 } ).sort( {$natural : -1} ).limit(1).next() )

Delete exisitng oplog
db.oplog.rs.drop()

Create new oplog
db.runCommand( { create: "oplog.rs", capped: true, size: (2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) } )

Insert the Last Entry of the Old Oplog into the New Oplog
db.oplog.rs.save( db.temp.findOne() )

Restart
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /srv/mongodb
